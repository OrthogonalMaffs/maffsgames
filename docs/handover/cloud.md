# Handover: cloud lane

The cloud lane's running handover (canon §7.8.2). Only cloud-lane sessions edit this file; the home lane's is
`docs/handover/home.md`. Newest first. Keep it current on the branch as you go (CLAUDE.md, checkpoint discipline).

**Cloud lane owns:** per-game fixes in games that are currently unlisted, one game per PR, each with its verifier,
closing its entries in its own `docs/audits/findings/<slug>.yml`. It never edits `schools/assets/`, the shared
modules in `scripts/`, the workflow, canon, the roster's listed section, `docs/todo.md` or
`docs/audits/REGISTER.md` (CI regenerates that on main). Relisting a fixed game is the home lane's docs PR.

**Standing rule (Jon, 7 Oct 2026):** after each game's PR merges and main's full run is green, start the
next game on the contract's list without asking. Stop only for a STOP IF or an empty list.

**Remaining list (contract LH, 7 Oct 2026; added by the home lane, kept by the cloud lane):** take a game off
this line in the PR that finishes it. `scripts/check-answer-lock.py` reads it. While a game is on it, a
failure of that game in the check is reported, not failed; off it, a failure fails CI.
`cloud-remaining:`

**Lane rule, listed games (Jon, 8 Oct 2026; contract "listed-game CRITICAL/HIGH"; the home lane records it in
canon §7.8 in its next docs PR):** the cloud lane now also fixes listed games. Before starting one, add it to the
remaining list above and push that handover commit on its own, so the home lane's F1 batches skip it; take it off
in the PR that fixes it. One game claimed at a time; never claim a game already in an open home-lane F1 batch branch
(check `docs/handover/home.md` and the open PRs first; if it is, skip to the next and note it).

**Resume rule, MaffsLock (Jon, contract LH):** adopting MaffsLock includes the game's lock-hint declaration
(`<!-- maffs-lock-hint ... -->`, canon §7.6.0), and the game passes `check-answer-lock.py`. Hints live in the
game's page, never in the shared script.
A two-option game declares an `answer` that picks the option differing from its key for `i >= 1` (canon
§7.6.0, contract DET, 8 Oct; prime-or-composite is the pattern).

**Contracts (Jon, 8 Oct 2026, corrected 20:00):** each contract is saved verbatim as
`docs/handover/contracts/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<name>.md` in its claim commit (or the PR's first commit), with one line
in the queue below pointing to it. Read it when the item starts, not at session start (the folder stays out of the
start-up load). When the work merges, move the file to `docs/history/`.

**Queue:** UC-FIX: DONE, #196 merged 9 Oct (c9fbf4b), main green.
SIM-S5: DONE, #203 merged 9 Oct (4081538). UC-T4-007: fix PR #205 (the answers' item 3c, in
`docs/history/contracts/2026-10-09-sim-s5-answers.md`; claim #204). Then FT-FIX without asking: contracts/2026-10-08-ft-fix.md as amended by -ft-fix-amend.md (step 3 and t5-008 go to the home lane).
Done: PP-T1-004 (#189; its contract is now in `docs/history/contracts/`).

**Every PR:** `python scripts/check-changed.py` before the first push; merge only on a green Gate, and never while
main's last full run is red; watch main's run after merging.

## 2026-10-09 (cloud): UC-T4-007, unit-converter (claim #204; fix #205 takes the game off the remaining list)

- **The fix (Jon's answer 3c):** the 60 mph item reads "Convert 60 mph to m/s (1 mile ≈ 1609 m). Give your answer to
  3 significant figures."; key 26.8 m/s unchanged. t4-007 closed with the ruling.
- **Verifier:** the t4-007 NOTE is now a check: "=" before a stated conversion fails unless it is the exact
  definition; "≈" before a rounded one passes. A plant puts "1 mile = 1609 m" back and is caught (11 plants).
- **Main's run on 4081538 (SIM-S5) green**, run 583. #204's PR run: E 36 s, B3 1m32s (the plan ran few verifiers).
- **Moved to the archive:** the entries before SIM-S5's claim. Still live from them: **for the home lane**, a B5
  group before the next verifier lands in B (main's run on c9fbf4b had B4 at 5m17s of its 6m budget); the timer
  list and MIGRATED notes are in SIM-S5's claim entry below.
- **Next: FT-FIX** (`contracts/2026-10-08-ft-fix.md` as amended). From the PP-T1-004 entry: merge main first;
  factor-theorem is in check-answer-lock's MIGRATED, so it must still pass; `wrapExamVocab` is the shared
  `schools/assets/exam-vocab.js:109` (step 3 and t5-008 go to the home lane, per the amendment); both
  `question_index` calls already send `qIdx + 1`; the contract's line numbers are stale (re-find by quoted text).

## 2026-10-09 (cloud): SIM-S5 built (claim #202; fix #203 takes the game off the remaining list)

- **Stage 5** in simultaneous-solver: its own screen and flow (`startForm`, beside the A-Level one); Stages 1-4
  untouched (four existing lines widened: a trailing comma, a third `MaffsNext.clear`, two test hooks). `WORDS`
  bank between markers, worded as the contract (the verifier compares it); 8 a session, 3 W and 3 E at least;
  a mark per line (16); board `foundation-s5` with its label, coverage entry and hub row (Jon's authorisation).
- **EqTiles**, the builder: self-contained (build, read, parse, mark, markAll, tokens, text; `.eqt-*` CSS), exact
  fractions; tiles are whole terms (letters, the keys' numbers, + − =, distractors); Delete and Clear line.
- **Distractors (no invention):** a spare number in the text (not 1) or a pounds amount in pence (SR-4, the
  partly-scaled error). 35 of 40 have fewer than two: for Project Claude to supply if wanted (list in the PR).
- **Feedback notes** (one line each, where the key needs a fact the words leave out): W07, W11, W12, W13, W15,
  E05, E09, E11; listed in the PR for Jon.
- **Verifier** (group E): solutions held only there; every key's forms marked by the page's own EqTiles; tiles
  build every key; 60 draws; sessions tapped at 390x844 and 1280x900; MaffsLock; 3 plants. Stage 5 adds ~30 s.
  check-answer-lock seeds 1-3 PASS. **For the home lane:** the roster row could mention Stage 5 (yours).
- **For the home lane (SIM-S5 item 9): the build freeze has one named exception, Jon, 9 Oct 2026 (00:25): Simultaneous
  Solver Stage 5 only. Record it in canon §0.2 and the todo ("Stage 5 is parked under it" no longer holds).**

## 2026-10-09 (cloud): SIM-S5 claimed (Jon's answers, 08:10)

- **Option A, approved:** a Stage 5 tile builder in simultaneous-solver, marked as a non-zero multiple of a key; the
  builder is a self-contained object (build, read, mark; no reach into Stages 1-4) so it can become a shared module.
- **Jon (9 Oct, in session): the `foundation-s5` board's three shared lines land in the SIM-S5 PR** (as the roster's
  Calculator field did in UC-FIX): its label in `schools/assets/firebase-leaderboard.js`, its entry in
  `scripts/check-leaderboard-coverage.js`'s simultaneous-solver list, its hub row in `leaderboards/index.html`.
  Additive, nothing else in those files.
- **For the home lane (answers 3b):** `.claude/rules/timer-policy.md`: move Unit Converter from "Hidden Count-Up" to
  "No Timer" (since #196 it shows, logs and scores no clock). A shared rules file, so the cloud lane does not edit it.
- **For the home lane:** unit-converter passes check-answer-lock on seeds 1-3: move it to MIGRATED (your question).
