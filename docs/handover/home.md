# Handover: home lane

The home lane's running handover (canon §7.8.2). Only home-lane sessions edit this file; the cloud lane's is
`docs/handover/cloud.md`. Newest first. Keep it current on the branch as you go (CLAUDE.md, checkpoint discipline).

**STANDING RULE (Jon, 7 Oct 2026):** when a contract finishes and the next queued contract's start condition is
met, start it without asking. Stop only for a STOP IF, a decision no standing ruling covers, or an empty queue.

**Home lane owns:** shared code, shared assets, CI and canon (contract F's shared fixes, then contract C), and every
docs PR: `docs/todo.md`, the roster's listed section, relisting fixed games (batched).

**QUEUE (home lane), Jon, 8 Oct 2026 (night)**, replacing the checkpoint's "ask Jon for that queue" note. Run in
order; the standing rule applies (start the next item when one finishes; stop only for a STOP IF, an unruled
decision, or a checkpoint). Each contract's verbatim text is below the list; move it to the archive when it merges.
1. **ESSENTIALS-WORDING: DONE, #172 merged 8 Oct (c1fc37a).** Its verbatim text was in Jon's queue message only.
2. **RELIST-3: DONE, #176 merged 8 Oct (c0c825b).** (Jon, 8 Oct, sent after the queue.) It
   supersedes RELIST-ES-TB, sent minutes earlier: same relists, plus listing Just Pythag It, Bruv (Jon approved it).
3. **CHANGED-UTF8: DONE, #178 merged 8 Oct (d73d3b6).**
4. **GA4-COUNTRY-CANON: DONE, #179 merged 8 Oct (3c3217c).**
4a. **VOCAB-SHOWTHAT: DONE in #180** (Jon, 8 Oct, sent later: run after GA4-COUNTRY-CANON, before F1 batch 7). The "show
   that" tooltip in `schools/assets/exam-vocab.js`; closes factor-theorem-t5-009 unless the cloud lane holds that game.
5. **F1 batch 7, then F1 batch 8**, exactly as the standing F1 item below states (8 per batch, Year 6/KS3/GCSE/
   Core first; read `cloud-remaining:` in `docs/handover/cloud.md` on main before building each batch and drop
   every game on it).
6. **CHECKPOINT after batch 8 merges with main green:** update this file and stop. Do not start batch 9 in that session.
- **Answer-lock L1 flake:** act only if it recurs (the follow-up below stands).
- **Standing F1 item:** the remaining listed games, Year 6/KS3/GCSE/Core first, 8 per batch, until NOT_YET is empty
  (NOT_YET: 40). **Before building each batch** (contract CLAIM, canon §7.8.2): read `cloud-remaining:` in
  `docs/handover/cloud.md` on main and drop every game on it from the batch. Never claim or edit a game on that
  line. For a listed game the claim is a process lock only: check-answer-lock.py still judges it as unclaimed.
- **Follow-up (home lane, CI): Answer lock L1 failed on main once (b66ccde, run 37776985917)** with five games at
  once (binomial-blaster, curling-friction, differentiation-duel by touch at 390px; force-resolver, moments-master
  UNPLAYABLE after Start). The same slice passed 20/20 locally on that commit, the parallel run (3878582) was green, and
  a rerun of the failed job passed. Canon 7.6.0 says a verdict never depends on timing: if it recurs, find what the
  driver waits on that a slow runner breaks (start(), the touch path), and fix it there, not with retries.

**Jon's rulings, 7 Oct:** eigenvector-engine-f0-005 is not a judgement call (SR-17: a scalar multiple of an
eigenvector is never a wrong option, whatever the prompt says about "simplest"): `jc: false` (in #108). The
verifier-lines-in-the-workflow question is answered by contract V: neither lane edits the workflow for a verifier.

## 2026-10-08 (home): MAIN-RED, like-terms-collector's verifier typed before the question settled (branch `claude/ltc-focus-race`)

- **Main red after #180** (47ee9b9, run 37811456669 attempt 1), Content verifiers E: `FAIL item 1: typed 8.9/6.5,
  marked correct=None, expected False` and `the feedback does not say why: ''`. **The re-run (attempt 2) passed: main
  green again, Jon told.**
- **Cause (in the verifier, not the page):** `loadInputQuestion()` focuses `#ans0` on a 50 ms MaffsLock timer. The
  verifier typed as soon as `#ans0` was visible; Playwright's `fill('#ans1')` selects the box and inserts the text in a
  second step, and when the timer fired between the two, "6.5" went into `#ans0` ("8.965", `#ans1` empty), so Check
  marked nothing (an unreadable box is not an answer). Shown directly: interleaving the two steps leaves
  `['8.965', '']` and no mark. The same "marked correct=None" as run 37626794263 (6 Oct), which the 6 Oct and #167
  fixes did not touch: likely the cause after #89 and #109 too.
- **Fix:** type only once the page's own focus is on `#ans0` (its signal that the question has settled); `read_mark`
  takes the mark from the same call that saw it land. Local: the other verifiers that `page.fill` (just-pythag-it-bruv,
  six-sevens) fill one box, so a focus timer cannot redirect their text; component-crusher's and split-it's (the
  other 50 ms focus timers) set values in the page.
- **Proof:** a 100 ms runner stall inside `fill('#ans1')` (select, stall, insert): main's verifier fails 3/3 with main's
  exact message; this one passes 3/3. A 200 ms gap after every Playwright action: passes 3/3. Plain: 20/20.

## 2026-10-08 (home): VOCAB-SHOWTHAT (#180, branch `claude/vocab-showthat`)

- `schools/assets/exam-vocab.js`: two strings only, "show that" (Jon's exact text) and "hence show" ("prove" -> "reach").
  Only factor-theorem loads the file (STOP IF clear); its "show that" questions are all numerical (f(a) = 0).
- Proof: on the stub server in Chromium, factor-theorem practice Q3's tooltip reads the new text.
- factor-theorem-t5-009 closed here (`status: fixed`, `pr: 180`, `ruling:` Jon's 8 Oct ruling): nothing claimed on
  `cloud-remaining:`, no open PR touched factor-theorem or exam-vocab.js. The cloud lane's factor-theorem queue already
  left t5-009 out.

## 2026-10-08 (home): GA4-COUNTRY-CANON (#179, merged 3c3217c)

- Canon §1.2.1 "GA4 country tabs" added after §1.2 (the analytics section), in #153's proposed text, plus "Live only once
  Jon has installed it" from the contract's fallback line. The contract's anchor, a "'Users' are not people here" note,
  does not exist in canon; #153's own reading bullet says it, so that bullet now opens "'users' are not people here".
- STOP IF checked: #153's description and `docs/ga4-country-setup.md` agree on what is collected (aggregates GA4
  already holds; nothing new; site, analytics.js, endpoint and privacy page unchanged).
